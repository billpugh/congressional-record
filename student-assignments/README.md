# Student assignments for CMSC 398z

You need to be on the student-assignments branch in order to see this.

Create and switch to your own branch that has your name in it (so it won't clash with that of any other student). For example, I might use

```bash
git checkout -b pugh-assignment
```

Create a file in this directory with _your name_.md that gives your name, the issue you are working on, and if you are working with 
a partner, there name as well.

Add and commit that file, and then push that change.

switch back to the main branch of the project. When you do that, the student-assignments directory will disappear (because it doesn't exist on the main branch.
