# congressional-record

This tool converts HTML files containing the text of the Congressional Record into structured text data. It is particularly useful for identifying speeches by members of Congress.

From the repository root, type `python -m congressionalrecord.cli -h` for instructions.

- It outputs JSON
- Instances of speech are tagged with the speaker's bioguideid wherever possible
- Instances of speech are recorded as "turns," such that each subsequent instance of speech by a Member counts as a new "turn."
